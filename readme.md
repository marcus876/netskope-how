**<h1> Netskope Cloud Security Workshop automation through Terraform Workspaces </h1>**

  **SLACK: #netskope-csw** with all pinned information and credentials

--- 

This terraform module creates Netskope Hands On Lab Environment with predefined custom student images that contain neccessary configuration parameters for the lab

terraform works with so called workspaces, so you can switch into individual "working environments". One can create multiple lab environments in different workingspaces at the same time.

Every workspace creates a DNS subzone of sselab.eu in the initials of the individual instructor

terraform.state will be saved on remote S3 buckets with versioning, encryption enabled in DynamoDB
